        <h1>Hi! I'm Krishanth</h1>
        <p>I am a first-year engineering student with an interest in learning web development.
             I am currently exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and enjoy building simple websites as part of my coursework. I like understanding how things work and improving my skills through practice and small projects.
              This page is a part of my learning journey in web development.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <p>I enjoy listening to music as it helps me relax and stay focused.
             I like playing volleyball and working out at the gym, which keeps me active and disciplined.
              I also enjoy hanging out with friends and traveling to places with difficult or adventurous terrain,
               as it gives me new experiences and challenges. In addition, I like reading thriller novels, 
               which keep me engaged and improve my imagination.</p>
